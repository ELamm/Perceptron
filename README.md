# Perceptron

This was the first assignment for my machine learning class. 

File: description:
1. ps1.pdf: assignment
2. spam_train.txt: training data
3. spam_test.txt: test data
4. ELamm_PS1.pdf: what I submitted
5. PS1.py: my original code (it's messy and long - but we were limited in use of packages)
6. PS1_revisited.ipynb: more like how I code now - liberal use of pandas!
